      <h3>Creation of this website</h3>
      <p>I used Atom to write my codes for this website and I found that a few packages and themes in Atom made the editing process a lot easier. These packages and themes are: 1. <a href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-html-preview"> atom-html-preview</a> package by harmsk 2. <a href="https://atom.io/themes/atom-material-syntax">atom-material-syntax</a> theme by atom-material 3. <a href="https://atom.io/packages/fonts">fonts</a> by braver.</p>
      <p>Before I created the website I thought about a simple template for my "About" page.</p>
      <div id="web-template">
        <img src="images/web-template.png" alt="Website Template">
      </div>
      <p>After creating the sufficient HTML and CSS files, I uploaded my website to GitHub. I go through the steps on how to do this below, click <a href="#GitHub">here</a> to jump to that</p>
    </div>
    <div id="web-process">
      <h3>Process in creation</h3>
      <p>To start off I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE"> Learn CSS in 12 Minutes</a> by Jake Wright. You should watch this if you want to get a simple understanding of website layouts. <br><br> I first created a HTML file called about.html, note that the first page of your website must be called index.html but subsequent ones can have any name of your choice. Next I gave my page a title, a header, some content (body) and a footer. I then reorganised the body content into different divisions with different IDs. I later added in a navigation bar, for this I will go into more details later on. </p>
      <p>To make my wesite look the way it is, I used a stylesheet written in CSS called style.css. This is what makes the website have an organised and aesthetic feel to it. Without this, the website would just be very plain and full of text without any design or filled with misaligned images and texts. To use this stylesheet you need to link it to your HTML file in the head segment.</p>
      <p>There are many other elements in this website that also made use of CSS stylesheets and they will be listed below.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>HTML file for "About" page</h3>
      <p>This is what my about.html file contains. I will talk about the navigation bar later on.</p>
      <img src="images/about-html.png" alt="about.html Content">
      <h3>CSS file for "About" page</h3>
      <p>This is what my style.css file contains for the 'About' page. I changed my font to the current one by adding a link in the html file as you can find above. This font "Oxygen Mono" by Veron Adams can be found <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxygen+Mono?query=oxygen">here</a>.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="web-nav">
      <h3>Navigation bar creation</h3>
      <p>To start off I created a simple unordered list using the class function. This was placed in the body. I wanted my navigation bar to have a dropdown function when I hovered over it. I wanted it to also stay at the top of my page when I scrolled down. For this navigation bar I used references from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHFflWvii3M">How To Make Drop Down Menu Using HTML And CSS</a> by Easy Tutorials.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Here is the HTML codes for the navigation bar. Remember to put the active tag on the link that is currently active so that your CSS will work.</p>
      <img src="images/navbar-html.png" alt="Navigation Bar HTML">
      <p>This is the CSS code I used for my navigation bar. It is not perfect but it works and does its job. There are some things that I couldn't figure out a way to change but it looks fine, just don't stare too long at it :).</p>

    <div id="web-extra">
      <h3>Here is some extras found in this website</h3>
      <p>Let's start with the <b>vertical timeline</b> found in the "My Projects" page. For this timeline, I took references from <a href="https://codepen.io/htmlcodex/pen/LYGjPgV?editors=1100">Super Simple Timeline</a> by HTML Codex. I took their timeline and changed up some things to make it fit below the navigation bar and also fit my aesthetics. I simply just adjusted the navigation bar to have a z-index of 10. Also for this timeline I used a different stylesheet called style_timeline.css as I didnt want to mix up the contents found in my original stylesheet. This timeline also made use of icons found from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/"> Font Awesome</a>.</p>
