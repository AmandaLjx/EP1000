      <h3>Creation of this website</h3>
      <p>I used Atom to write my codes for this website and I found that a few packages and themes in Atom made the editing process a lot easier. These packages and themes are: 1. <a href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-html-preview"> atom-html-preview</a> package by harmsk 2. <a href="https://atom.io/themes/atom-material-syntax">atom-material-syntax</a> theme by atom-material 3. <a href="https://atom.io/packages/fonts">fonts</a> by braver.</p>
      <p>Before I created the website I thought about a simple template for my "About" page. I added a few things after that what this is the main layout.</p>
      <div id="web-template">
        <img src="images/web-template.png" alt="Website Template">

    <div id="web-process">
      <h3>Process in creation</h3>
      <p>To start off I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE"> Learn CSS in 12 Minutes</a> by Jake Wright. You should watch this if you want to get a simple understanding of website layouts. <br><br> I first created a HTML file called about.html, note that the first page of your website must be called index.html but subsequent ones can have any name of your choice. Next I gave my page a title, a header, some content (body) and a footer. I then reorganised the body content into different divisions with different IDs. I later added in a navigation bar using some reference from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHFflWvii3M">How To Make Drop Down Menu Using HTML And CSS</a> by Easy Tutorials, for this I will go into more details later on. </p>
      <p>To make my wesite look the way it is, I used a stylesheet written in CSS. This is what makes the website have an organised and aesthetic feel to it. Without this, the website would just be very plain and full of text without any design or filled with misaligned images and texts. </p>
